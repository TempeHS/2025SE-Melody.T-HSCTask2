# HSC Task 2
ML Model for prescribing contact lenses.

### Description
A medical company has approached me as a Data Engineer to develop a model to be used as a contact lenses perscription service for doctors. The model will prescribe the type of contact lenses based on data in a patient's medical record. 

The **success metric** is to create a reliable ML model that can correctly identify the type of contact lenses based on data given.
